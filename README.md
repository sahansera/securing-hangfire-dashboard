## Introduction
By default, if you try to access your Hangfire dashboard, it will work perfectly fine on your localhost because local requests are allowed. However, things can get a bit tricky when you want to secure your Dashboard.

This repo targets on providing a starting point to securing your Hangfire dashboard in production with .NET Core 3.1

With this approach, you can have a nicely decoupled way of protecting your Hangfire dashboard route. You can also move the authorisation logic to a custom extension method and inject your custom services as opposed to using a Hangfireâ€™s authorisation filter.
